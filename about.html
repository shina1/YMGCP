In summary, the NGO looks forward to a Nigeria and a world of peaceful co-existence with transparent governments that have the will and zeal to serve their people.

                                    case study, and to unite the youths through peace advocacy, community and tolerance-enhancing activities. Hence, YMGCP was
                                    conceived and birthed in September 2019 to proffer solutions to these problems. </p>

                                Mr. Olalekan Abdur-Rahman is the founder of YMGCP. He has a three year experience in legal practice and earned a bachelor’s degree in common and Islamic law from the University of Ilorin, Ilorin. He holds a professional certificate in human resource management, project management, health safety and environment and procurement, logical and supply chain management. Abdur-Rahman is an enthusiastic and energetic youth with potentials directed to ensure rapid progress and development of himself, immediate society, and the world in general. He worked with community-based organizations for three (3) years as a volunteered staff in capacity of secretary to advanced education pursuit and awaken the dwindling reading culture in the youths. He also volunteered at an international-based organization to train high school students on company management. Abdur-Rahman volunteers weekly at a local orphanage to equip orphans and care givers with entrepreneurial based vocational training, tools and support.

                                Abdur-Rahman is a highly motivated society reformer with terrific interest in societal remediation and history. He is a youth advocate, SDG advocate. He thrives in innovation, networking and career building. His long term aspiration is to correct the socio-political anomalies of his fatherland (Nigeria) through his NGO (YMGCP) and establish strong institutions. He conceived and birthed YMGCP in September 2019 to proffer solutions to the problems of political, social and religious instability currently being experienced in several countries around the globe. He observed that political instability and social vices in several countries and our immediate society is not solely as a result of bad leadership as posited by many, but a product of distorted
                                communal orientation and a selfish political culture. This must be corrected by reconfiguring our societal value system, attitude of members of the society and increasing political awareness in the society if any change is to be effected. YMGCP has come to stay to lend her voice to correcting these anomalies.

                                In the face of increasing unrest, injustice and weak institutions around the globe today, the need to lend our voice and to give members of the community a platform, to demonstrate focus on peace, justice, and strong institution/ community building necessitated the Young Minds for Good stewardship, Community & Peace Building (YMGCP) to

                                The problem the organization seeks to address is very vital to the continuous peaceful existence of the world. There is no dispute about the fact that discrimination and terrorism have become the order of the day and if not given proper attention now, it may degenerate to conflict and separation among different nations that formed countries of the world.
                                The rate of tribal and race violence is alarming and corruption is at its peak while poverty has become a prominent identity of themasses due to mismanagement of resources by leaders in the corridors of power of many third world countries.

                                It is on the basis of the incumbent challenges around the world and threat against peace that we seek to address this problem
                                through massive re-orientation of the young ones, re-orientation of the old blocs; salvage the system from total collapse and to
                                collectively build an egalitarian, serene and violent-free nations.

                                It is in our humble opinion that if peace and justice are not given required attention promptly the situation might degenerate to permanent disintegration of many nations.
